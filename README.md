# Android Release Doctor

Open-source, local-first tool for auditing Android APK and AAB releases before publication.

> **Status:** early development — M0.3 Google Play release readiness.

Android Release Doctor inspects the **artifact you are actually going to distribute**, can compare it with the Android application Gradle configuration, and can apply a versioned Google Play submission-readiness profile.

## M0.1 scope

The release artifact is inspected deeply enough to extract:

- application/package identity;
- versionCode and versionName;
- minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion;
- effective `android:debuggable` state;
- declared permissions;
- Android components and explicit `android:exported` requirements for supported component types with intent filters;
- DEX payloads, native-library ABIs, and signature metadata presence.

The parser reads the compiled binary AndroidManifest.xml directly from the APK/AAB. It does not invoke the Android SDK or external shell tools. For AABs, M0.1 inspects the base module manifest.

## M0.2 scope

M0.2 adds static project-side evidence from:

- `build.gradle`;
- `build.gradle.kts`.

The project parser extracts the Android application module's:

- namespace;
- applicationId;
- compileSdk;
- minSdk;
- targetSdk;
- versionCode;
- versionName;
- release debuggable/isDebuggable declaration.

The audit can compare those declarations with the final APK/AAB manifest. This is intentionally a **static cross-check**, not a Gradle evaluator: variant resolution, product flavors, CI-generated versioning, and arbitrary Gradle code are not executed.

## M0.3 scope — Google Play release readiness

M0.3 adds an explicit `--play` readiness profile. The profile is versioned as `2026-08-31` and supports platform-specific target API requirements for:

- `mobile`;
- `wear`;
- `automotive`;
- `tv`;
- `xr`.

The current profile checks the final artifact's target API level and reports the applicable Google Play requirement. It also surfaces manual release checks for Play Console information that cannot be proven from an APK/AAB alone, including Data Safety, privacy-policy readiness, and App content declarations.

For artifacts containing native libraries and targeting API 35 or higher, M0.3 also flags 16 KB page-size compatibility for manual verification. It does not yet inspect native ELF load-segment alignment.

### Play readiness usage

Mobile is the default Play platform:

```text
android-release-doctor --play app-release.aab
```

Use an explicit platform when needed:

```text
android-release-doctor --play --play-platform wear app-release.aab
android-release-doctor --play --play-platform tv app-release.aab
```

Project and Play checks can be combined:

```text
android-release-doctor --project app/ --play app-release.aab
```

Without `--play`, the previous M0.1/M0.2 behavior remains unchanged.

## Still not implemented

- full Gradle/variant evaluation;
- product-flavor-aware expected-value resolution;
- CI/generated version resolution;
- cryptographic signature verification;
- Android signing block inspection;
- native ELF 16 KB alignment inspection;
- current Google Play policy automation beyond the M0.3 readiness checks;
- permission risk classification;
- HTML/SARIF output.

## Development

```bash
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo run -p doctor-cli -- tests/fixtures/minimal-release.apk
cargo run -p doctor-cli -- --project tests/fixtures/project-release tests/fixtures/minimal-release.apk
cargo run -p doctor-cli -- --play tests/fixtures/minimal-release.apk
```

## Design principles

- **Local-first:** release artifacts and project configuration are inspected locally.
- **Evidence before conclusions:** findings are tied to observable project or artifact evidence.
- **Actionable diagnostics:** warnings explain what to change.
- **Versioned rules:** Android and Play requirements change, so rules are explicit and replaceable.
- **Artifact first:** the final APK/AAB remains the source of truth for what is actually being distributed.
- **Conservative project parsing:** Gradle code is never executed.
- **Manual means manual:** when Play requires information that the binary cannot prove, Release Doctor reports a concrete review item instead of pretending it can verify it.
